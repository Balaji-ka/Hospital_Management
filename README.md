# Hospital_Management
The project involves the creation of a web application utilizing HTML, CSS, SQLite, and Django as the backend framework. The primary purpose of this application is to manage hospital services and appointment scheduling for patients.

The frontend is built using HTML and CSS to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. This allows users, including both patients and hospital staff, to navigate the application with ease.

The backend of the application is powered by Django, a Python-based web framework. Django handles various functionalities, including user authentication, routing, and data management.

The application caters to two main services: hospital service management and appointment scheduling. Hospital services encompass tasks such as managing patient records, medical histories, and treatment information. The appointment scheduling system enables patients to request appointments and hospital staff to manage and confirm those appointments.

SQLite is used as the database management system, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of data related to patients, appointments, and hospital services. The application is designed to handle various database operations, including data insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

In essence, this project combines HTML, CSS, SQLite, and Django to develop a web application tailored for managing hospital services and appointment scheduling. The frontend provides an intuitive interface, while the backend manages data and interactions. SQLite serves as the database system for storing and retrieving patient and appointment information, with Django orchestrating the various functionalities of the application.
